# Abstract

Inspired by [PhD thesis](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/31553/3/Weissbock_Joshua_2014_thesis.pdf) written by Joshua Weissbock where he developed a model for prediction NHL hockey game results, we decided to create and apply similar model for [KHL hockey league](https://en.khl.ru/).

Even though our model outperforms Joshua's in terms of accuracy (64.8% vs 59.8%), we don't consider this result as fair. We suggest that the reason of this phenomena is the fact that our leaugue is just unbalanced and, as a result, more predictbale (especially in 2015-2016 season when the most part of the dataset was collected).

The project was done as a student practical project in [Computer Science Center](https://compscicenter.ru/).
